# Spirit

A series of exercises for Elixir newcomers to practice with the language.

Instead of writing code on a platform like Exercism, this project aims to mimic
most of the workflow of local development, giving the learner means of not only
solving exercises but also understanding the project structure and builtin
tooling.

The code is in a *very* early stage with the following general ideas in mind:

- Exercises are to be structured in modules that match the [Elixir Getting
Started guide](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html)

- The learner would clone the repo (or their own fork of it) on their local
machine.

- A mix task would be run to generate a chapter's module containing functions
(with empty bodies) along with a full test suite. The learner would write the
functions and run `mix test` until all the tests pass before moving on to
repeat the whole process with a new chapter. This workflow should have the
following advantages:
    + The initial state is a near empty repo that closely matches the
    boilerplate generated by `mix new` and reduces clutter for someone
    exploring an Elixir codebase for the first time.
    + Running Mix tasks to generate code resembles using Phoenix generators.

- Help content should be inside typical Elixir documentation like `@doc` and
`@moduledoc`.
